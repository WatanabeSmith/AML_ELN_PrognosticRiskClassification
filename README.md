PrognosticRiskAssignmentAndAnalysis.Rmd is the primary script, which will use the other R scripts (risk_caller and karyotype_parser) while running.

PreScriptCleanup.Rmd was used to take raw BeatAML data and convert into the usable format shown in the Data folder. The underlying data for this script is not included in this repository as the database is as of yet unpublished.
